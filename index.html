                                I am a 24 year old Nigerian. I live and work in Midtown Atlanta. I love to travel and am
                                obsessed
                                with Harry
                                Potter. I have lived in 7 different cities in the US in the 8 years that I have been
                                here. I speak 2
                                languages
                                (English and French), and understand 2 others (Yoruba and Bini).
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                I have a BA in Industrial
                                Psychology from the University of Kentucky, and a MS in Business Communications from
                                Spalding
                                University in Louisville, Kentucky.
                                I have a background in HR and worked for 2 years with Huamana, Inc. I currently work for
                                BlackRock
                                (the world's largest investment management firm) as a recruiting coordinator for our
                                campus
                                recruiting program. Specifically, I coordinate the recruiting of software engineers into
                                our Summer
                                Analyst and Program Analyst classes.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Working with software engineers and learning about their needs and work projects got me
                                interested
                                in the field. BlackRock is also a FinTech company and technology in general is a huge
                                part of what
                                we do. The more I thought about this, the more I realized that I owed it to myself to
                                learn a little
                                more about this field. It would not only help me be better at my role, but it would also
                                give me the
                                flexibility to pursue a different career if I so chose.
                                Moving to Atlanta and working out of the office located on Georgia Tech's campus gave me
                                the
                                opportunity to enroll in Georgia Tech's coding bootcamp.
                                My hope is to gain some knowledge that I would be able to use in my current role, and my
                                career
                                going forward.
